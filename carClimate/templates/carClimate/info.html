            Globally, transport accounts for around a quarter of CO2 emissions. And much of the world's transport networks still remain focused around the car. Road vehicles – cars, trucks, buses and motorbikes – account for nearly three quarters of the greenhouse gas emissions that come from transport 
        </p>
        <p style="width: 800px;">
            The average petrol car on the road in the UK produces the equivalent of 180g of CO2 every kilometre, while a diesel car produces 173g of CO2/km. In the US the average passenger vehicle on the road release 650g of CO2/km. Generally, the larger the car, the higher the emissions.
        </p>
        <p style="width: 800px;">
            Driving a newer vehicle can reduce these emissions – in Europe the average emissions for a new petrol car in 2018 was 123g of CO2/km.
        </p>

        <p style="width: 800px;">
            But in many cases it may be possible to avoid using the car altogether. In many countries, even short journeys which could often be made on foot or by bike are usually made by car. In England, for instance, around 60% of 1-2 mile trips are made by car.
        </p>

        <p style="width: 800px;">
            “From our perspective, the really low hanging fruit is the journeys that people could walk,” says Stephen Edwards, head of policy and communications at Living Streets, a British charity that promotes walking. “There's an immediate contribution that we could all make to reducing our personal carbon emissions by walking more of those short journeys, whether it be to school, to the shops, to work or to the station.”
        </p>

        <p style="width: 800px;">
            People often face psychological barriers to walking, says Edwards, and Living Streets aims to support people as they try to change their behaviour. During National Walking Month in May, it encourages people to substitute just one short car journey a day for a walk, and to experiment with incorporating walking into their daily routine.
        </p>

        <p style="width: 800px;">
            Cycling, which shares many of the climate benefits of walking, is increasingly a viable alternative to car journeys, too. Some countries have sped ahead in bike transport: in the Netherlands 26% of journeys are made by bike, followed by Denmark on 18% and 10% in Germany. All three countries had major policy changes in the 1970s and 1980s that led to a large increase in cycling, and all continue to invest in cycling infrastructure. Often people may discard cycling as a viable option for longer distance travel. But electric bikes and networks of segregated cycle lanes are beginning to change what is possible in terms of commuting distance, says Leo Murray, director of innovation at climate change charity Possible (formerly 10:10 Climate Action).

            Dom Jacques, a parent of two from Leeds, in the UK, decided to do something when he became frustrated at the amount of congestion at the gates of his children’s school. Concerned about the potential impacts of air pollution and chaotic traffic on small children, he set up a local group to advocate for fellow parents to avoid driving their cars up to the school and convinced the school to become involved with the Living Streets walk to school programme.
        </p>

        <p style="width: 800px;">
“The children were being educated about the benefits of walking on a daily basis,” he says. “They log their journeys daily as part of the project, they get really involved in the process… Then you can track whether you’ve been successful. It gives you a real insight into what’s happening.”
        </p>

        <p style="width: 800px;">
            Living Streets says walk to school rates have increased by 23% after five weeks in schools where its programme has been implemented, while car journeys have fallen by around 30%.
